			<span class="funky-text"><em>T</em></span>he expression not merely focuses on the fact that the guy is creating something, but also talks about his way of expressing his knowledge through practical application. He is exercising what he learnt through books in a real-world scenario. No matter how many lessons he might have taken or how many assignments he may have aced, what mattered at that moment is how accurately he could apply his learning of so many years. Here arises the question of practical knowledge.
			The <strong>Centre for Research and Exams in Science and Technology (CREST)</strong> is established by some of the prominent names in education industry. This initiative aims to assess the practical knowledge that would help students to apply their learning in different areas and excel in the same.

				<h2>CREST Mission</h2>
				<!-- </div> -->
				<!-- <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
				<p>
					We need to understand that a child’s personal mode of learning is in fact through experiencing what is happening and recognising things through practical questions or application of the knowledge that they have gathered by learning, through schools, parents, peers, etc. This makes the child enhance their speculative knowledge and they are able to judge in accordance to the facts.
					The child’s practical knowledge paves the way of knowing about different subjects and letting them dig deeper into the subject which is difficult to go through theoretical knowledge. <br>
					<strong>CREST strives to:</strong>
					<ul>
					<li class="valign-wrapper"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Ask questions that will force the students to think deeper for the answers and the question will expose their practical knowledge.</li>
					<li class="valign-wrapper"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Build competitive spirit among students so that they always try to achieve better.</li>
					<li class="valign-wrapper"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Embrace the power of digital technology for writing exams.</li>
					<li class="valign-wrapper"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Encourage students to go for practical knowledge in Olympiads rather than rote learning in school.</li>
					<li class="valign-wrapper"><i class="material-icons">keyboard_arrow_right</i>Build a foundation for different competitive exams like JEE, NEET, etc.</li>
					</ul>
